# Changelog

## Unreleased

- MTP: Word Wise no longer breaks delivery. Reading the Kindle's dictionary and sending the book
  now share one MTP connection; closing the first one reset the Kindle, which dropped it to the
  home screen and off the bus ("device is no longer connected"). Reopening also falls back to the
  serial number when the bus address is stale.
- MTP: no USB reset on close. On a Scribe 2024 the reset dropped it off the bus until replugged.
- MTP: Word Wise is skipped with a warning when the Kindle hides `system/` over MTP (Scribe 2024),
  where its dictionaries live; the book and X-Ray still ship. Delivery errors name the file.
- Word Wise on MTP Kindles reads a copy of the Kindle's dictionary staged at
  `documents/deckle/kll.en.en.klld`.
- Manual Amazon ASIN per book (app: ⋯ → Set Amazon ASIN…; CLI: `run --asin`). With EBOK the
  Kindle fetches the store cover, so MTP Kindles get covers with X-Ray and Word Wise.
- Word Wise hints show on the Kindle: English books that get Word Wise are tagged `en` (not
  `en-US`), without which every hint was a blank gap; hints never point at Amazon's
  definitionless placeholder senses.

## 0.1.0 — first release (pre-alpha)

- EPUB → KFX with Enhanced Typesetting through Kindle Previewer 4, repackaged by a Rust port of
  kfxlib (byte-exact against its output); approximate page numbers.
- Cleans EPUBs for Previewer: JPEG cover marked `cover-image`, large images downscaled, scripts
  and remote resources removed, a TOC when the book has none; font-obfuscated (DRM-free) EPUBs
  are accepted, DRM is refused.
- The cover rule: EBOK plus a Deckle-written thumbnail on mass-storage Kindles (restored after
  Amazon's "no image" overwrite), PDOC on MTP-only Kindles and folder exports; per-book and
  per-Kindle overrides; optional Amazon edition matching through Open Library.
- Delivery to mass-storage Kindles and, through Deckle's own PTP/MTP client, to MTP-only
  Kindles (Scribe 2024, Colorsoft, Paperwhite 2024); export to a folder.
- X-Ray sidecars: heuristic people and terms, optional LLM descriptions (Anthropic or any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint), optional Wikipedia summaries.
- Word Wise sidecars from Deckle's Wiktionary-derived dictionary (downloaded once, 12 MB),
  pointing at the Kindle's own dictionary when present.
- Desktop app for macOS 14+ and Windows 11 (Tauri); `deckle` command line for everything.
- macOS builds are signed with a Developer ID and notarized; Windows builds are unsigned in v1.
- Known gaps: not yet verified on real Kindles (see `docs/devices.md`).
